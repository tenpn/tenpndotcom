        Does your AI have to choose between many actions any one time?
      %p.lead
        Run to cover, fall back, shoot, or pick up health, depending on location, player actions, and health?
      %p.lead
        Eat, drink, work, exercise, or sleep, depending on AI thirst, hunger, wealth and fitness?
      %p.lead
        Align the player with one of several factions, depending on player action time and location? ...

        Is it a mess of special-case nested if-else statements, or a tangle of state transitions?
      %p.lead
        Is it time-consuming to maintain and balance? Is it buggy and hard to understand?

        Delete all that code! Decision<em>Flex</em> for Unity can help!
      %p.lead
        Decision<em>Flex</em> great at making emergent and human-like AI. It is quick to integrate, with minimal code, full tutorial, and docs. You don't need to understand any complex maths to use it.
      %p.lead
        Decision<em>Flex</em> is easy to balance and maintain, using tools you know like the hierarchy and animation curves. It is based on Utility Theory, an increasingly popular approach to decision making.

            Hierarchy
          %p.lead
            The hierarchy lays out the decision, its actions, and the considerations for each action. It's easy to construct and read.

            Considerations
          %p.lead
            Tell Decision<em>Flex</em> how to weigh the factors influencing each action. Use animation curves to easily compare apples to oranges. No complex maths necessary.
