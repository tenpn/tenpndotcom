            Hierarchy
          %p.lead
            The hierarchy lays out the decision, its actions, and the considerations for each action. It's easy to construct and read.

            Considerations
          %p.lead
            Tell Decision<em>Flex</em> how to weigh the factors influencing each action. Use animation curves to easily compare apples to oranges. No complex maths necessary.
