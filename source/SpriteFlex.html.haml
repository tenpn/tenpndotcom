            Wireframe
          %p.lead
            Break your art down into individual parts like hair and eyes. Arrange them so when they overlap it looks like one big sprite. This is a wireframe.

            Variations
          %p.lead
            Create as many variations of each part as you like. The more the better, but even a handful will give hundreds of variations when combined. At runtime Sprite<em>Flex</em> can add even more variation through random scaling, placement and mirroring.

            Putting it together
          %p.lead
            Tell Sprite<em>Flex</em> about the wireframe using our components. Let it put everything together at runtime. Full scripting control over the process, if you need it.
