        Decision<em>Flex</em> works for your game
      %p.text-center
        Should your simulated person eat or drink next? What target should the AI shoot next? With what weapon? Should the football team consolidate the lead or go for broke? Decision<em>Flex</em> can even be used for non-opponent tasks, like modelling player behaviour!

        Decision<em>Flex</em> does one thing really well: it weighs up all the options in the context of the current situation, and makes a considered choice. No fluff, no sprawling frameworks that takes over your codebase.

        Already using a state machine? Let Decision<em>Flex</em> decide when to transition. Using steering behaviours? Let Decision<em>Flex</em> inform the weights. Have an isolated decision? Decision<em>Flex</em> is just as happy by itself.

        Decision<em>Flex</em> is built upon the hierarchy window and animation curves, so designers don't have to learn new tools. Programmers can easily expose variables to allow designers to construct their own decisions.

        Decision<em>Flex</em> is, out of the box, fast and allocation-free, so it can work at large scale. It also comes with tools to schedule and timeslice decisions, to give you fine control.

        Decision<em>Flex</em> is open for extension. Write new context containers, schedule decisions at your own pace, or add new custom considerations.

        Decision<em>Flex</em> is namespaced, to avoid polluting your codebase. It has a <a href="https://trello.com/b/3rKsv3jg/decisionflex">public bugs list</a>. Updates will include release notes and upgrade paths. It uses semantic versioning.
