                          :alt => "Hierarchy and animation curve tools"}
      %p.text-center.lead 
        It uses <strong>familiar Unity editor tools</strong>, including the hierarchy window and animation curves, in an intuitive manner.

            Hierarchy
          %p.lead
            The hierarchy lays out the decision, its actions, and the considerations for each action. It's easy to construct and read.

      .thumbnail
        %img.img-responsive{:src => "images/decisions-shot.png", :alt => "Decisions made out of lego-brick components"}

          %h3
            Decisions
          %p.lead
            Snap together decisions out of lego-brick components. How often should a decision be made? Should the best action be chosen, or do you need slightly more fuzzy human behaviour?
    .col-md-6
      .thumbnail
        %img.img-responsive{:src => "images/considerations-shot.png", :alt => "Animation curves weighing considerations"}
        .caption

            Considerations
          %p.lead
            Tell Decision<em>Flex</em> how to weigh the factors influencing each action. Use animation curves to easily compare apples to oranges. No complex maths necessary.

            Fast and smooth
          %p.lead
            Optimised out-of-the-box to never allocate. Fast, and copes fine with pooling. Comes with tools to timeslice decisions across multiple frames for budgeting.
